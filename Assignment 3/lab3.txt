1. Downloaded Coreutils 8.29.
Moved it to the linux sever

2. The following steps are for installing the program:

Access SEASnet linux server through putty
ssh austinz@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu

Unzip tar file
tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

Make a directory to which to install the program
mkdir coreutilsinstall

Go to the folder where coreutils was unzipped
cd coreutils-8.29

Configure and install
./configure --prefix=/w/home.07/ee/ugrad/austinz/Desktop/coreutilsinstall

Compile the package
make

Install the program
make install prefix=/w/home.07/ee/ugrad/austinz/Desktop/coreutilsinstall

3. The following steps are for reproducing the problem:

Go to the folder
cd ../coreutilsinstall/bin

Run the command
./ls -aA

This included . and .. in the output, which is unintended, as specified by the assignment.

4. Applying the patch
Go to the coreutils-8.29/src folder

Create a file called patch.diff in the current folder and paste in the contents of Eggert's patch.

Change the path names to /w/home.07/ee/ugrad/austinz/Desktop/Coreutils-8.29/src/ls.c for both both the original file and the modified file for ls.c

Change the path names to /w/home.07/ee/ugrad/austinz/Desktop/Coreutils-8.29/tests/local.mk for both the original file and the modified file for local.mk

Patching ls.c
patch -p9 < patch.diff 

Go to the coreutils-8.29/tests folder
Create a file called patch.diff in the current folder and paste in the contents of Eggert's patch.

Change the path names to /w/home.07/ee/ugrad/austinz/Desktop/Coreutils-8.29/src/ls.c for both both the original file and the modified file for ls.c

Change the path names to /w/home.07/ee/ugrad/austinz/Desktop/Coreutils-8.29/tests/local.mk for both the original file and the modified file for local.mk 

Patching local.mk and tests/ls/a-option.sh:
patch -Np1 --ignore-whitespace < patch.diff

Check to see if patch was successful:
vim ls.c
vim local.mk

The change has been successful. 

5. Compiling and Installing

Navigate to coreutils-8.29 
cd ..

Run autoreconfigure:
autoreconf -f -i

Compile again
make

6. Testing fix
To test the fix, run ./ls -a -A on an empty directory
