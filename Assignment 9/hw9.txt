2. 
Check out version 3.0 of diffutils from my repository into a branch named 
"quote":
	cd diffutils
	git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'

3. 
Installing change into this new branch:
	patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4. 
Learn how to use the Emacs function

5. 
For each of the six files above, I opened them in emacs and in the 
changlog, I used (C-x 4 a) to add an appropriate message.g

6. 
Committed my changes to a new branch:
	git add .
	git commit -aF ChangeLog

7. 
Generated the patch:
	git format-patch -1 --stdout > formattedpatch.txt

8. 
My partner sent me his patch, which I renaimed partner-patch.txt

I first created a new branch called 'partner':
	git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0' 

Applying the patch:
	git am partner-patch.txt

I repeated the compilation process to check if it works:
	./bootstrap
	./configure
	make
	make check

9. 
I used the command 'make distdir' and opened the ChangLog file to check 
that my partner's change was the most recent change in the log.

10. 
Cloned the repository into a new folder called repo:
	git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git repo

Output:

First, I logged out of the linux server and reconnected with the -X option 
after installing Xming:
From piazza:
"Open up the command putty.exe by double-click it. It will brings up the 
interface. First, setup the connection info in Host Name (or use IP) field 
and select SSH (SSH is using port 22). In Connection Category, find the 

Connection tree. In SSH, expand it and you will see Tunnels window. Click 
"Enable X11 forwarding". It is setting the default to X display at 
"localhost:0". Now, go back to Session and save this session with a name 
you like. I normally use the Host Name to make me easily remember where I 
am connecting to."

After that is done:
	cd ~/Desktop/CS35L/Lab9/repo
	gitk

This opened a window in XMing. The newest file not newer than 2015-01-25
