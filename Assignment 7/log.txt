Assignment 7

For this lab, I worked with Kenny Chan (004769092)

Before I started, I set up the beaglebone using the instructions on piazza 
and START.htm. I then installed the correct drivers (64-bit).

To connect the beaglebone to wifi, I opened putty, typed in the IP address 
in the host address bar, and when prompted for a username, I entered root 
with no password. 

To connect to wifi, I used the following commands:
	sudo connmanctl
	connmanctl> enable wifi
	connmanctl> scan wifi
	connmanctl> services
	connmanctl> agent on
	connmanctl> connect wifi_506583d4fc5e_544e434150413937414239_managed_psk
	Passphrase? 3760ClassNet
	connmanctl> quit

To install firefox, I used the following commands:
	sudo apt-get updated
	sudo apt-get install xauth
	sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-|10n-en-gb

To check that I had the openssh-server and openssh-client installed, I used 
the following command:
	dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

I did not have them, so I installed them with these commands:
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
	sudo apt-get install openssh-client

My partner SSHed into my beaglebone, which meant that I was the server.
The server generated public and private keys for the client with the command
	ssh-keygen

Creating an account for the client:
	sudo useradd -d /Desktop/CS35L/Lab7 -m kman
	sudo passwd kman69

Created a .ssh directory:
	cd /Desktop/CS35L/Lab7
	sudo mkdir .ssh

Changed ownership and permission:
	sudo chown -R kman .ssh
	sudo chmod 700 .ssh

My partner inputted the commands for the client side:
	Generated public keys: ssh-keygen
	Copied keys to server: ssh-copy-id-i kman@<my_ip> ... ssh-add
	SSH'd into my server: ssh -Y kman@<my_ip>
	Opened firefox: firefox

This allowed us to browse firefox from my partner's laptop. After this, we switched roles, where I was the client and he was the server.
