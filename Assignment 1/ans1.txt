1.) 
command: man -k [keyword]
This command was found by using the hint provided (man man) and locating the appropriate command 
based on the description.

2.) 
command1: which cp
command2: which sh
location1: /usr/bin/cp
location2: /usr/bin/sh
We can find the location of commands in the file system using the which command.

3.)
command: find /usr/bin -name "?"
The following one character commands were found with explanations using man and help:
'.': Read and execute commands from FILENAME in the current shell environment and return the exit 
     status of the last command executed from filename. This fails if FILENAME cannot be read.
':': No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding arguments and performing any specified 
     redirections. Exit status always succeeds
'w': displays information about the users currently on the machine, and their processes.
'[': Evaluate conditional expression.

4.)
First I navigated to /usr/bin using the command cd /usr/bin and ran the command ls -l | grep emacs. 
This shows that the following link is actually executed:
/etc/alternatives/emacs

5.)
/usr/bin/emacs uses version number 22.1.1 while the regular emacs uses version 24.3.1. They are 
different because one is by default instsalled with the system. 

6.) 
g+s means that the user using the file will get the same permissions as the group (denoted by g) 
that owns the file.
o-x removes execution permission from other (denoted by o) users that do not own the file or are 
not in the group.

7.)
command: find /usr/local/cs -type d -ctime 30
This was determined using the command man find. 30 is the number of days and /usr/local/cs is the
path.

8.) 
command: find /usr/bin -type l | wc
271 symbolic links

9.) 
librom1394.so.0.3.0
commands: 
cd /usr/lib64
ls -lt | grep ^-
This lists the regular files in order of newest first. librom1394.so.0.3.0 was at the bottom of 
the list.

10.) The command locale gets its data from the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, 
Chapter 7, Locale.
command: man locale

11.) 
command: C-h a downcase
The commands with downcase in their name:
downcase-dwim
downcase-region
downcase-word

12.)
C-M-r: reverse regular expression search
C-M-s: regular expression search
C-M-t: transpose sexps
C-M-u: move backward out of one level of parentheses
C-M-v: scroll help window
commands: 
C-h b to show commands
C-s to search for each command
C-s to go to the next occurance of the search parameter. 

13.)
C-g signals a quit condition and cancels the command being entered.
commands: 
C-h b to show commands
C-s to search for C-g

14.) 
yank pastes the last section of text that was "killed." This is bound to C-y
commands: 
C-h b to show commands
C-s to search for yank

15.)
The only noticeable difference was that the output of the dired command contained two lines on 
information about the current and parent directories.
commands:
ls -l
dired
