sfrobu.txt

A text file sfrob.txt containing the results of your sfrob performance comparison as described in 
the homework.


sfrobu:

time ./sfrobu < reallybig.txt > output_sfrobu

real	0m5.691s
user	0m0.277s
sys		0m5.421s


sfrobu -f: 

time ./sfrobu -f < reallybig.txt > output_sfrobu

real	0m5.881s
user	0m0.298s
sys		0m5.528s



sfrobs:

time ./sfrobs < reallybig.txt > output_sfrobu

real	0m0.081s
user	0m0.020s
sys		0m0.026s



sfrobs -f:

time ./sfrobs -f < reallybig.txt > output_sfrobu

real	0m0.081s
user	0m0.022s
sys		0m0.029s


From the results, it is clear that from the time function, the shell script version 
is much, much faster than the C program with system calls. The version tagged with -f
of each is a little bit slower than without the -f tag.
